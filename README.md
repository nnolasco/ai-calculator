# Calculator App

This calculator app is a simple React application that provides basic arithmetic operations. The code for this app was generated by ChatGPT-4, an AI language model developed by OpenAI.

This code is largely unedited from what GPT4 provided. In addition to the .js code, it also provided .css code for styling. I tried to get it to generate this README.md file, but kept running into the problem where the prompt window kept autodetecting the code and messing up the formatting.

# Getting Started
